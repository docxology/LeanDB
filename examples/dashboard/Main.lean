/-! # dashboard — importing bases into another project

Not a base. `Tickets` and `Eats` are ordinary Lake dependencies; this
program gets their types, their `base` values and their query defs, and
uses them two ways:

- **in-process**, against each base's instance file: `Base.withInstance`
  opens the file with the base's own schema check and runs the query
  defs directly — the same `DbM` code the bases' CLIs run;
- **over the stdio wire**, against a served base: `Client.connect` spawns
  `tickets serve`, shakes hands on the fingerprint, and `client%
  slaBreached` is the query's signature with `DbM` replaced by
  `ClientM` — arguments render through `CliRender`, results decode
  through `QueryIn`, so the remote call is typed like the local one;
- **over HTTP**, against `tickets serve --http`, using the standalone
  `leandb-http` adapter and its libcurl-backed `leanhttp`
  transport. The same typed stub and result checks are unchanged.

Run from `examples/dashboard` after `lake build` here and
`lake build tickets` in `../tickets`. -/
